NOTE 
- Touch won't currently build from the PC as Xamarin.iOS is currently in the lab under development.
- To make it build on the Mac you will need to substitute the 'real PCLs' with versions built using Xamarin.iOS on the Mac

The steps to get this Touch UI working are:

1. Add a reference to your Core PCL project
2. Create a Setup.cs file
3. Modify AppDelegate.cs to create the new Setup and to call the IMvxAppStart
4. Add a views folder and a view - cs - change the UIViewController inheritance to MvxViewController
5. Edit the ViewDidLoad in the cs to add a bound control - e.g:

        public override void ViewDidLoad()
        {
            View = new UniversalView();

            base.ViewDidLoad();
            var uiLabel = new UILabel(new CGRect(0, 0, 320, 100));
            View.AddSubview(uiLabel);

            this.CreateBinding(uiLabel).To<FirstViewModel>(vm => vm.Hello).Apply();

            // Perform any additional setup after loading the view
        }

Where this requires using's of:

    using YourNameSpace.Core.ViewModels;
    using Cirrious.MvvmCross.Binding.BindingContext;
    using Cirrious.MvvmCross.Touch.Views;
