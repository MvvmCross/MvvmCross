MvvmCross v3
============

This project provides a cross-platform mvvm mobile development framework built on top of:

- Silverlight for WP7, WP8
- Mono for Android  (or Xamarin.Android)
- MonoTouch for iOS  (or Xamarin.iOS)
- the WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps.
- Windows Universal projects (WPA8.1 and Windows 8.1 Store apps)
- WPF
- Mono for Mac (or Xamarin.Mac)

This project makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications. 

**Additional support available for:**
- [MvvmCross for Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Forms)
- [MvvmCross for Android Support library](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-AndroidSupport)
- [MvvmCross with SQLite](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-SQLite)


Getting started
---------------

A really quick way to get started is to use the Visual Studio 2012 MvvmCross Ninja Coder Extension - download it from [Visual Studio Gallery][ninjavsgallery]

![Ninja Plugin][ninja]

I have started a tutorial series entitled [N+1 Days of MvvmCross][n1] starting with the basics of your first MvvmCross application and covering lists, commands, binding, and more with samples for each device. The code for N+1 Days of MvvmCross is available on [GitHub][n1github]

For more documents and articles, see the [Wiki][mvxwiki]

For more samples, see the [MvvmCross Tutorials Repository][mvxtuts]

About MvvmCross...
------------------

This project was born from:

- a fork once long ago of the MonoCross project, moving away from MVC and towards MVVM
- an extension project from [www.cirrious.com][cirrious]
- some ideas from MvvmLight
- some ideas from ASP.NET MVC
- some ideas from OpenNetCF (Phone7.Fx)
- lots of my own ideas - [www.cirrious.com][cirrious] and [my blog][slogdeblog]

Here is the framework in action for the sqlbits conference app:

v3
--

This is the third version of the MvvmCross platform - v3.

For more info on what this version specifically aims to provide, see:

- [MvvmCross v3 blog post][mvxv3]

If you are looking for the "older" version of MvvmCross, then it's still available and still receiving updates on the master branch at

- https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/tree/master
- https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/tree/vNext

How to get involved
-------------------

If you have questions, then please ask them on [StackOverflow][so] with tag MvvmCross

Alternatively, people on [Xamarin Forums][xf] can be very helpful

There is a Jabbr room - on [#mvvmcross][jabbr] - but please ask questions on StackOverflow if you can - this helps make the questions and the answers better!

If I haven't seen your question and no-one else has helped, then you can also contact me - me at slodge dot com - but please be patient with me if I'm busy with work.

If you need professional support, then please do contact me - I work freelance and can assist. Please do consider hiring me - everyone likes 'free', but I'm worth paying for :)

If you find bugs or have feature requests, then please report them through GitHub - https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/issues

If you would like to help make MvvmCross even better, then please do:

- new code - including pull requests via GitHub - or you can fork the project and build your own extensions
- new plugins - can be hosted in your own repositories
- please do blog about your adventures with MvvmCross - we're currently very light on documentation!
- if you use the framework, then please let me know - we love to see what people are doing with it.
