	# MvvmCross vNext

This project provides a cross-platform mvvm mobile development framework built on top of Silverlight for WP7, Mono for Android and MonoTouch for iOS, and the WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store applications.

This project makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.

# Getting started

For setting up your development environment to support portable libraries, see the steps in http://slodge.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/mvvmcross-vnext-portable-class.html

To learn about what MVVM is... please look at this introduction from Infragistics http://blogs.infragistics.com/blogs/anand_raja/archive/2012/02/20/the-model-view-viewmodel-101-part-1.aspx and http://blogs.infragistics.com/blogs/anand_raja/archive/2012/03/06/introduction-to-the-model-view-viewmodel-pattern-part-2.aspx.

For some background on Portable Libraries see http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsplaisted/archive/2012/08/27/how-to-make-portable-class-libraries-work-for-you.aspx

http://vimeo.com/39019207 provides a video of me talking about this project (with poor noise quality - sorry...)

MvvmCross made it briefly to Channel9 - see http://slodge.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/mvvmcross-on-channel9.html

To see how MvvmCross provides ViewModels, Views and bindings, see the samples within this project. This really is the best "Getting Started" information available.

# About MvvmCross...

This project was born from:

- a branch of the MonoCross project, moving away from MVC and towards MVVM
- an extension project from http://www.cirrious.com
- some ideas from MvvmLight
- some ideas from ASP.NET MVC
- some ideas from OpenNetCF (Phone7.Fx)
- lots of my own ideas - http://www.cirrious.com and http://slodge.blogspot.co.uk/

Here is the framework in action for the sqlbits conference app:

# vNext

This is the second version of the MvvmCross platform - vNext.

This version specifically provides:

- the same databinding and viewmodel framework from the original MvvmCross release
- an increase of code sharing through the use of portable class libraries
- a new plugin structure which makes it easy to consume and to reuse platform-specific code within your views and viewmodels

The motivation for the changes between version 1 and vNext are summarised in: http://www.slideshare.net/cirrious/mvvm-cross-going-portable
 
If you are looking for the "old" version of MvvmCross, then it's still available and still receiving updates at https://github.com/slodge/MvvmCross/tree/master
