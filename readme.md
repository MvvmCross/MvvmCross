# MvvmCross v3

This project provides a cross-platform mvvm mobile development framework built on top of:

- Silverlight for WP7, WP8
- Mono for Android  (or Xamarin.Android)
- MonoTouch for iOS  (or Xamarin.iOS)
- the WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps.
- WPF
- Mono for Mac (or Xamarin.Mac)

This project makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.

# Getting started

A really quick way to get started is to use the Visual Studio 2012 MvvmCross Ninja Coder Extension - download it from http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/618b51f0-6de8-4f85-95ce-a50c658c7767

I have started a tutorial series entitled [N+1 Days of MvvmCross](http://mvvmcross.wordpress.com) starting with the basics of your first MvvmCross application and covering lists, commands, binding, and more with samples for each device. The code for N+1 Days of MvvmCross is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MvvmCross/NPlus1DaysOfMvvmCross)

For more documents and articles, see the wiki: https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/wiki

# About MvvmCross...

This project was born from:

- a fork once long ago of the MonoCross project, moving away from MVC and towards MVVM
- an extension project from http://www.cirrious.com
- some ideas from MvvmLight
- some ideas from ASP.NET MVC
- some ideas from OpenNetCF (Phone7.Fx)
- lots of my own ideas - http://www.cirrious.com and http://slodge.blogspot.co.uk/

Here is the framework in action for the sqlbits conference app:

Alternatively, people on Xamarin forums can be very helpful - http://forums.xamarin.com/

There is a Jabbr room - on http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/mvvmcross - but please ask questions on StackOverflow if you can - this helps make the questions and the answers better!

If I haven't seen your question and no-one else has helped, then you can also contact me - me at slodge dot com - but please be patient with me if I'm busy with work.

If you need professional support, then please do contact me - I work freelance and can assist. Please do consider hiring me - everyone likes 'free', but I'm worth paying for :)
