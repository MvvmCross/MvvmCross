In order to integrate FormsPresenters plug-in correctly, please follow these steps:

1. Rename MvxFormsApplicationActivity.cs.txt to MvxFormsApplicationActivity.cs and move it to the Xamarin.Android project's root

2. Rename SplashScreen.cs.txt to SplashScreen.cs and move it to the Xamarin.Android project's root.
   Remove any previous splash screen source code file previously generated by MvvmCross packages

3. Add the following piece of code to Setup.cs from Xamarin.Android project:

	protected override IMvxAndroidViewPresenter CreateViewPresenter()
    {
        var presenter = new MvxFormsDroidPagePresenter();
        Mvx.RegisterSingleton<IMvxViewPresenter>(presenter);

        return presenter;
    }
