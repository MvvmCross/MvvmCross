In this first Model-View-ViewModel project, we'll create a simple single screen cross-platform application for calculating the tip at a restaurant.

Here's a sketch of where we hope to end up:

The goals of this first application are all about **introducing**:

1. the general structure of MvvmCross applications
2. some of the code elements required in all MvvmCross applications
3. how data-binding support on Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS (the products formerly known as Mono for Android and MonoTouch)

Within this guide, we won't attempt to provide any introduction to the Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Xamarin products and platforms - there are plenty of guides available already for all of those. Instead, we'll focus instead on pure, unadulterated MvvmCross Nirvana.
