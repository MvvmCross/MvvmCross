Welcome to the TipCalc Tutorial! In the following guide we will create a simple Cross-Platform app to introduce some key concepts and showcase some MvvmCross features.

The application consists on a single screen for calculating the tip at a restaurant.

Here's a sketch of where we hope to end up:

The goals of this first application are all about **introducing**:

1. The general structure of MvvmCross applications
2. Some of the code elements required in all MvvmCross applications
3. Data-Binding

Within this guide, we won't attempt to provide any introduction to the Apple, Google, Microsoft, or Xamarin products. We will focus on pure, unadulterated MvvmCross framework.
