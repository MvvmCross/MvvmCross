The `ResourceLoader` plugin provides access to files bundled within the app package.

- On Android, this is for files bundled in the `Assets` folder and marked as Build Action of `AndroidAsset`
- On iOS and Windows, this is for files bundled with a Build Action of `Content` 

On several platforms, the ResourceLoader plugin requires an `IMvxFileStore` is available. One easy way to supply this is to load the `File` plugin.

The main interface supplied by this plugin is:

```c#
public interface IMvxResourceLoader
{
    bool ResourceExists(string resourcePath);
    string GetTextResource(string resourcePath);
    void GetResourceStream(string resourcePath, Action<Stream> streamAction);
}
```

For a text file 'Hello.txt' bundled in a folder 'Foo', this can be called as:    

```c#
var loader = Mvx.Resolve<IMvxResourceLoader>();
var contents = loader.GetTextResource("Foo/Hello.txt");
```
