The `Email` plugin provides a cross-platform implementation for sending emails.

```c#
public interface IMvxComposeEmailTask
{
    void ComposeEmail(string to, string cc, string subject, string body, bool isHtml);
}
```

The Email plugins is supported on all platforms.

The implementation on Windows Uwp and Wpf is very simplistic - using only 'mailto:' url-open requests.

To send an email you can use:

```c#
Mvx.Resolve<IMvxComposeEmailTask>()
.ComposeEmail("me@slodge.com",
              string.Empty,
              "MvvmCross Email
              "I <3 MvvmCross
              false);
```
