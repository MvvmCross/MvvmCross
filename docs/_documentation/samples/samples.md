#### MvvmCross Samples 

We have a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Samples) full of samples at your disposal. Don't hesitate to open an issue (or even better - a PR)  if you see anything wrong!

#### StarWars Sample

Inside the samples repository you will find the [StarWars Sample](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Samples/tree/master/StarWarsSample) app, which is fairly comprehensive app that showcases many MvvmCross features. It's available for iOS and Android at the moment.

#### Give me the latest and greatest please!

Inside our main repository there is a sample app which contains lots of test scenarios and supports every platform. Check it out: [Playground](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/tree/develop/Projects/Playground).
