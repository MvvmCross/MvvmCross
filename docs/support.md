Got stuck? Need help? Get in touch with us on these different platforms. We do our best to answer your questions.

**[StackOverflow][so]**

Use StackOverflow to find already asked questions, and post new questions with details about your problem. Do add tags to at least MvvmCross and Xamarin so we are able to find it.

**[Discord][discord] - #mvvmcross channel**

Use Discord to get in touch with us directly, and ask quick questions. After joining the DotNetEvolution Discord, go to the MvvmCross channel to find all other MvvmCross users.

**[Xamarin forums][xf]**

Use the Xamarin Forums for specific questions where neither StackOverflow or Discord works for you.

**[GitHub issues][gi]**

Use only GitHub issues for actual bugs with the framework. We try to keep GitHub issues only for bugs, feature requests, roadmaps and the like.
