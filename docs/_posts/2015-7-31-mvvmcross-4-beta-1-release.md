Improvements, new features, updated samples and more!

We've released the first beta version of MvvmCross 4.  Among the new things this release contains are:

- Nuget support for Visual Studio 2015
- Backstack handling for MvvmCross Caching Fragments
- New and improved [samples](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Forms/tree/master/Samples) for MvvmCross Forms presenters for both Xaml and C# using Xamarin.Forms

The new release is available on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=mvvmcross).

Note that with the Visual Studio 2015 release it is no longer possible for us to automatically add files to the new project types, to get you started. You need to add files like Setup.cs and DebugTrace.cs yourself. We are not removing content from the nuget packages so support for "old type" projects remains.

The [wiki](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Forms/wiki) for MvvmCross Forms has been updated with new content and great explanations!

See the [issue list](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/issues?q=milestone%3A4.0.0+is%3Aclosed) for an overview of all solved issue's and merged pull requests.
Those lists are also available for [Android Support](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-AndroidSupport/issues?q=milestone%3A4.0.0+is%3Aclosed) and [MvvmCross Forms](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Forms/issues?q=milestone%3A4.0.0+is%3Aclosed)

If you need any help you can get in touch via the [JabbR #mvvmcross](https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/mvvmcross) room, or open a topic on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/new/mvvmcross) and tag it with "MvvmCross".

We will keep you posted.
