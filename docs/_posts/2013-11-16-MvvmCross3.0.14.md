After 3 betas, I've now pushed 3.0.14 to nuget and to the binary repo :)


This is probably the last 3.0.x release


The next release will hopefully be 3.1.x - for this next version we will drop Windows Phone 7.x support and aim to more fully support the new releases from Xamarin/Microsoft (Xamasoft?)


For my latest on how to use nuget with Xamarin, please see the run-through in http://slodge.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/quick-run-through-using-pcls-in.html



The changes in 3.0.14 over 3.0.13 are:
- Changes to nuspec files for more generic targets (I believe switching nuget to the latest 2.7.2 release will also help some users)
- Improvements in intrinsic boolean conversions
- Optimisation in nested bindings - changes to reduce the number of times source properties are fetched during updates
- Fix for spinner which caches the DataContext when a child window is switched off of the screen and then back in again (without going through an Adapter GetView)
- Virtual keyword additions to allow additional overrides for CreatingBinding and for GetIoCParameterValues
- Changes to ValueCombiners to allow them to better support UnsetValue - these now return the UnsetValue if any child is Unset
- Redirecting the Progress value in the Seekbar so that reflection is not used (very minor optimisation)
- Refactoring of Android layout inflation code - allowing custom view creation if required
- Provision of some Folder methods for the MvvmCross File plugin on WindowsStore (Win8/WinRT)
- A fix for MvxLinearLayout refresh issues
- A change of protected API for CreateBindingView in MvxAdapter - it now returns an IMvxListItem instead of an MvxListItem (this method is seldom overridden - but is a breaking change if you did override it)
- A fix for ThreadUtils - Wpf Package
- A fix for ViewModel creation for activities displayed via external Intents - e.g. from Mail or push links
- Change to Droid and Touch collections/lists - nullify the datacontexts of individual listview items when removed
- Wpf ThreadUtils assembly has been added
- Improvements in binding parsing of properties beginning with and containing underscores
- Improved error messages when binding fails
- Binding for Android RatingBar control
- ShouldReturn binding for iOS
- Fix to Or logic in ValueCombiner
- Provision for default parameters in ViewModel Init methods
- Inclusion of additional LinkerPleaseInclude entries for Android
- Trace optimisation - no messages shown for null datacontexts
