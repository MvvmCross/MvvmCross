We've heard only good feedback about last months 3.2.2-beta1 - so we've pushed 3.2.2 to nuget and to the binaries repo as a full release **today**.

The changes in 3.2.2 are:
- Additions to LinkerPleaseInclude for Activity.Title, CheckedTextView.Switch, UILabel.AttributedText, MvxViewController.Title
- A fix for base class Dictionary deserialization
- An optimisation for WinRT `File.Exists`
- A fix for iOS 8 CoreLocation permissions
- Email plugin fixes (thanks Mikkel Jensen)
- Intent Title localization fixes (thanks Mikkel Jensen)
- Yes!!! The return of Generic Views (thanks Stephanvs!)
- A very important WinRT Media Capture fix (thanks Luke Barnett)
- Heading included in WinPhone location plugin (thanks Marco Marche!)
- Fragment namespace defuddling (thanks Jeremy Kolb)

THANKS for all of these awesome contributions... THANK YOU :)


----------------

Coming up after this will be 3.5 - which involves bigger changes - especially:

- for Android Fragments (from the most Excellent @cheesebaron) 
- for iOS Unified support (from the most Excellent @kwlothrop)
- possibly for Windows navigation and tombstoning - see the discussions in https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/pull/835 especially driven by the most Excellent @promontis and @dbeattie71

We're hoping to push an alpha out of some of this really very soon indeed... :)
