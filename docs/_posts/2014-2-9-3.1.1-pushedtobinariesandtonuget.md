I've pushed 3.1.1 to nuget and to MvvmCross Binaries

The complete list of changes from 3.0.14 is below.

The main thing to be aware of is:

MvvmCross is now on profile 158 and so now does have official Xamarin support... but no longer supports WP7


The list for 3.1.2 is already forming on https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/issues?milestone=1&page=1&state=open 


Thanks to everyone who has contributed - you're all awesome and wonderful

Changes in 3.1.1-beta1:

- Switch to profile 158 for all portable assemblies
- Switch to WP8 for all WindowsPhone projects - plus System.Windows.Interactivity dependency updated to 3.9.5
- Fragging now uses the Google Xamarin.Android v4 support library rather than the Mono.Android one.
- Html email fix for Android
- Changes to nuget referencing (especially WP8 and SL5)
- To avoid angst, the existing SQLite plugin is no longer marked "obsolete" - I still encourage everyone to switch to the new community plugin as it is the better plugin (and I encourage people to step forwards to take over the admin of this too!)
- Improved helper method for subscribing to Interaction events
- A draft IMvxComposeEmailTaskEx interface has been added to the mail plugin allowing attachments and multiple addresses on some platforms. More work is still needed here


Changes in 3.1.1-beta2:

- softlion's Accessory fix for Content in Xamarin.iOS table cells
- removal of the unused Content set property accessor in in Xamarin.Android list view items
- inclusion of more efficient Exists methods in Windows Store
- allowing non-void command methods in CommandCollectionBuilder
- an attempt at fixing the KitKat spinner inflation problem thanks especially to Cheesebaron
- an initial Community SQLite 158 port thanks to CreepyGnome and Tofutim

Changes in 3.1.1-beta3 and 3.1.1-beta4:

- Android Email attachment thanks to @holgmans
- MvxNativeValueConverter inner-wrapper access thanks to @damirarh
- Tibet leak fixed for Xaml platforms
- Tabs fragment provide hook to allow transitions thanks to @softlion
- Droid Honeycomb list activation code included - thanks to several people
- MvxCommand changed to use weak reference event manager
- Droid Click and iOS TouchUpInside bindings changed to use CanExecuteChanged
- Company name included in all assemblies (to stop Windows Store complaining!)
- LayoutBorderWidth binding added in iOS - thanks to @stephanvs

Changes in 3.1.1-beta5:

- ImagePicker graceful handling of corrupt Android image files
- Fix for Tibet binding - functional form of ValueConverter calling now allows better handling for True, False and Null
- Minor fixes for a couple of improved trace messages 
- Refactor of MvxViewsContainer - Setup can now more easily override IMvxViewsContainer creation.
- IoC - warn users if we detect circular resolution
- IoC - provide PropertyInjector
- Fix for CanExecuteChanged binding on Touch - weak references were too weak.

Changes in from beta5 to 3.1.1 release:

- Default binding provided for UIProgressView
- NativeValueConverter improved (virtual methods provided)
- MvxColor debug output improved (argb not rgba)
- MvxViewModelLoader now initialised more cleanly as a singleton
