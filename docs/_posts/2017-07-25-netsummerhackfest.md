MvvmCross .NET Summer Hackfest

# The .NET Summer Hackfest
MvvmCross is one of the projects selected for the inaugural .NET Summer Hackfest, organized by the .NET Foundation! Running for two weeks from August 21st to September 1st, 2017, the MvvmCross session will see contributors from around the world work together virtually to build and improve the framework, with two exciting in-person events also planned! Participation is open to all, whether you’re a first-time or long-time contributor.

# How does it work?
We've create a new [GitHub project](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/projects/2) which lists all of the tasks planned during the two week period. Once you sign up, you can ask to get assigned to an issue and make a pull request!

The MvvmCross Core team will review any new issue and pull request as soon as possible in the two week hackfest to make the experience of contributing as smooth as possible.

## The main goals are to:
* Convert MvvmCross to the .NET Standard
* Update samples to latest version
* Add more async Task based code
* Update and create more website content
* Improve the documentation
* Work on up-for-grabs issues
* Join the .NET Foundation

# Join us in Amsterdam for the kick-off and closing events! 

## MvvmCross Hackfest Kick-off

* Join local MvvmCross contributors to kick off the two-week Hackfest with drinks and a few hours of coding!

## MvvmCross HackDay Closing Event
