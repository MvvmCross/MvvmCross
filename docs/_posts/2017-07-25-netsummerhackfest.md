# The .NET Summer Hackfest
MvvmCross is one of the projects taking part in the inaugural .NET Summer Hackfest, organized by the .NET Foundation! Running for two weeks from August 21st to September 1st, 2017, the MvvmCross session will see contributors from around the world work together virtually to build and improve the framework, with two exciting in-person events also planned! Participation is open to all, whether you’re a first-time or long-time contributor. 

## The main goals are to:
* Convert MvvmCross to the .NET Standard
* Update samples to latest version
* Add more async Task based code
* Update and create more website content
* Improve the documentation
* Work on up-for-grabs issues
* Join the .NET Foundation

## Why should I join?
Taking part in the MvvmCross .NET Summer Hackfest is a great chance to get started as a contributor to Open Source projects, to learn Xamarin and MvvmCross more in-depth and to get in touch with world-class mobile developers while giving back to the community. And every participant will also receive a set of MvvmCross goodies in the mail!

## How does it work?
We've created a new GitHub project (https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/projects/2) which lists all of the tasks planned during the two week period. Once you sign up, you can ask to get assigned to an issue and make a pull request! The MvvmCross Core team will review any new issue and pull request as soon as possible in the two week hackfest to make the experience of contributing as smooth as possible.
