- A new SQLite-PCL plugin [Plugins #1](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Plugins/pull/1) Note: the old SQLite plugin is discontinued and will no longer be updated
- Support for a MvxPageViewController that dynamically creates UIViewController pages via additional child ViewModels [#1121](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/pull/1121)
- The plugins are moved to their own repo [Plugins #3](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Plugins/pull/3) Note: the namepace of the plugins has changed to "MvvmCross.Plugins.*" now.
- The samples have been moved to their own repo [Samples #1](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Samples/pull/1)
- And lots of small fixes

The new release is available on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=mvvmcross).

Note that when you use nuget 2.8.5 or below you might get errors like: 'MvvmCross.HotTuna.CrossCore' already has a dependency defined for 'MvvmCross.HotTuna.Binding'.
In that case you can update mannually using [Nuget command line](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/issues/1088#issuecomment-130408367) or [patch the nuget files](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/comment/147377/#Comment_147377)
