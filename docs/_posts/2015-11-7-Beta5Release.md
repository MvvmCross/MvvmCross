Cross-platform sidemenu sample, fragment and plugin fixes


- Fixed bug to set images on UI thread: [commit](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/commit/a63eade49ae15f00a4e9305f45e9b6675c0f0e7d)
- WPF for SQLite PCL plugin [#26](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Plugins/pull/26)
- Added methods to reload a viewmodel when coming from the background [#1165](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/pull/1165)
- Added more support for Android Leanback [#107](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-AndroidSupport/pull/107)
- Refactored caching fragments to properly handle all situations [#86](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-AndroidSupport/pull/86)

Thanks to [Jammer](https://github.com/jamsoft) there is a new [cross-platform sample](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Samples/tree/master/Samples/XPlatformMenus) which uses sidemenu to navigate.
