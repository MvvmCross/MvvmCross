/*
 * This is not finished code - in fact it's hardly even started code!
 * 
 * Things to consider:
 * 1. Would be nice to remove the lifecycle thing that doesn't really work anyway!
 * 2. Would be lovely to avoice the way that the GetActivityForResult works - how does AzureMoileServices do that?
 * 3. Would be cool to improve memory use - e.g. when bindings get torn down 
 * 4. Essential that the fragment stuff makes sense
 * 5. Take a look at the Android Google IO conference sample from Google - treat that as best practice?
 * 6. Maybe just try porting the conference sample across?
