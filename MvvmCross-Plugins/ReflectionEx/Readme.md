### Reflection

The `Reflection` Plugin was intended to help fill in some of the gaps for the portable Reflection API set.

However, the gaps appear to be genuine (WindowsPhone and especially WindowsStore have different API subsets) - so this plugin is currently not very useful.

Current advice (August 2013): there's no reason to use this plugin.
