### SoundEffects

The `SoundEffects` plugin is only supported on WindowsPhone currently.

It uses the ResourceLoader plugin and allows small SoundEffect files to be played via:

    public interface IMvxSoundEffectLoader
        : IMvxResourceObjectLoader<IMvxSoundEffect>
    {
    }

    public interface IMvxSoundEffect
        : IMvxResourceObject, IDisposable
    {
        IMvxSoundEffectInstance CreateInstance();
    }

    public interface IMvxSoundEffectInstance
        : IDisposable
    {
        void Play();
        void Stop();
    }

Current advice (August 2013): this plugin isn't really useful outside of WindowsPhone today - hopefully some project will come along soon that needs this implemented on more platforms.
