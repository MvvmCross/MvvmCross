### Visibility

The `Visibility` plugin provides native implementations for the `MvxVisibility` enumeration.

`Visibility` is available on all platforms.

The `Visibility` functionality is generally not used directlt - instead it's generally used within ValueConverters used in Data-Binding. The plugin includes a couple of general purpose Value Converters - for more on these, see [The Mvx Visibility ValueConverters](https://github.com/slodge/MvvmCross/wiki/Value-Converters#the-mvx-visibility-valueconverters).
