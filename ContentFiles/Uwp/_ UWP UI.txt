The steps to get this UWP UI working are:

1. Add a reference to your Core PCL project
2. Change App.Xaml.cs so that it creates a 'new Setup(RootFrame)' during its OnLaunched:

        protected override void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs e)
        {
            var rootFrame = Window.Current.Content as Frame;

            // Do not repeat app initialisation when the Window already has content,
            // just ensure that the window is active
            if (rootFrame == null)
            {
                // Create a Frame to act as the navigation context and navigate to the first page
                rootFrame = new Frame();

                rootFrame.NavigationFailed += OnNavigationFailed;

                if (e.PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState.Terminated)
                {
                    //TODO: Load state from previously suspended application
                }

                // Place the frame in the current Window
                Window.Current.Content = rootFrame;
            }

            if (e.PrelaunchActivated == false)
            {
                if (rootFrame.Content == null)
                {
                    // When the navigation stack isn't restored navigate to the first page,
                    // configuring the new page by passing required information as a navigation
                    // parameter

                    var setup = new Setup(rootFrame);
                    setup.Initialize();

                    var start = MvvmCross.Platform.Mvx.Resolve<MvvmCross.Core.ViewModels.IMvxAppStart>();
                    start.Start();
                }
                // Ensure the current window is active
                Window.Current.Activate();
            }
        }
