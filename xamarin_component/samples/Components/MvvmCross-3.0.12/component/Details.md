First of all, give a short description of what your component does and
why someone would want to put it in their apps.

Then include a succinct code snippet or two showing the minimum viable
integration of your component into the user's app.

```csharp
using MyComponentNamespace;
...

public override void ViewDidLoad ()
{
	// Show the user how to setup your component
}
```
