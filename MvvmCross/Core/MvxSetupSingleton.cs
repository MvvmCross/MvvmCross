    /// EnsureSingletonAvailable - this is a static method that will return 
    /// the one and only instance of MvxSetupSingleton. This method is protected
    /// as it's assumed that each platform will provide a platform specific
    /// public overload for this method which will include any platform parameters
    /// required
    /// EnsureInitialized - this is an instance method that should be called 
    /// to guarrantee that setup has been created and initialized. This method 
    /// is blocking so make sure it's only called at a point where there
    /// are no other UI methods are being invoked. This method is typically called
    /// in applications where there is no splash screen.
    /// InitializeAndMonitor - this is an instance method that can be called 
    /// to make sure that the initialization of setup has begun. It registers
    /// an object to be notified when setup initialization has completed. The callback
    /// will be raised on the UI thread. This method is not blocking, and doesn't
    /// guarrantee setup initialize has finished when it returns. This method is 
    /// typically called by the splash screen view of an application, passing
    /// itself in as the object to be notified. On notification the splash screen 
    /// view will trigger navigation to the first view
