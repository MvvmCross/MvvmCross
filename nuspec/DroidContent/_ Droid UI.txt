The steps to get this Android UI working are:

1. Add a reference to your Core PCL project
2. Create a Setup.cs file
3. Add the MvxBindingAttributes file - make sure it's type is set to 'AndroidResource'
4. Add a splashscreen - both cs file and the axml to the Resources folder 
  - also remove any other `MainLauncher` activities - eg Activity1
5. Add a views folder and a FirstView view - also add FirstView.axml to the resources folder
6. Be sure to change the 'local:' namespace in the axml file - which may also require adding an AndroidManifest.xml file
