The steps to get this Core project working are:

1. Ensure your PCL is targeting a profile compatible with the MvvmCross.Forms dependency i.e.: Profile111

2. Add .Core to the name of the PCL project.

3. Change the Build Action of the following files from 'Page' to 'Embedded Resource':

    * Core|Pages|MainPage.xaml
    * Core|App.xaml

4. Delete the page that was created by Xamarin forms.

4. Add the MvvmCross Forms StarterPack package to the platform specific projects.

5. In Android: Remove the MainActivity.cs.

5. In the platform specific projects remove the reference to the core project and click ok. Then add the reference again.
   (This has to be done because the platform specific projects wont recognise the renamed core project)

6. In Android: in SplachScreen.cs change the label property in the attribute to your app name. Is now "YourAppName".

Note: It might be a good idea to manually remove the MvvmCross.Forms.StarterPack from the packages.config file,
      otherwise your files will be overwritten the next time you update your nugets. The ToDo folder can also
      be removed.
